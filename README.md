## **Insights Deep Dive**  
1. **Identifying Missing Values:**  
   - The **Income** column contained blank (null) entries.  

2 **Data Cleaning Approach:**  
   - Used **Power Query**: *Remove Rows > Remove Blank Rows* to eliminate missing income values.  

 **Handling the Outlier (666,666 in Income Column)**  
1. **Identifying the Outlier:**  
   - The **Income** column values ranged between **2,000 and 165,000**, except for an extreme outlier of **666,666**.  

2. **Outlier Handling Strategy:**  
   - Since **666,666** was far outside the normal range, it was replaced with the **median income** to prevent data distortion.
