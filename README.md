## **Insights Deep Dive**  


**Identifying Missing Values and Outliers**

Upon reviewing the dataset, the Income column contained several null entries, making it necessary to clean the data before meaningful analysis could proceed. These records were removed using Power Query’s Remove Blank Rows feature to maintain the accuracy of insights.

Handling the Outlier (666,666 in Income Column)

During exploratory data analysis, an income value of 666,666 stood out far above the rest of the data, which typically ranged from 2,000 to 165,000. To prevent skewing statistical results, this outlier was replaced with the median income of the dataset.
